# Observations

You might be wondering why we made the trivial counter application in the previous section and had it implement some silly requirements. Well, this is because it is simple enough to qualify as "Hello world" and at the same time shows you what Fable is all about, so let us go through the main points I wanted to conclude from the tiny counter app:

### Fable is a general-purpose compiler

Assuming you have done any javascript developement before, you surely have noticed how similar the F# code looked like in the first listing. In fact, if I was using pure javascript to implement the same app it would look something like this:
```js
const increase = document.getElementById("increase")
const decrease = document.getElementById("decrease")
const countViewer = document.getElementById("countViewer")

var count = 0;

increase.onclick = function(ev) {
    count = count + 1;
    countViewer.innerText = `Count is at ${count}`
};

decrease.onclick = function (ev) {
    count = count + 1;
    countViewer.innerText = `Count is at ${count}`;
};

countViewer.innerText = `Count is at ${count}`;
```
Crazy right?! this is almost what we wrote but with F# instead. This goes to say that Fable is not a specific framework to build web apps but rather a compiler that translates your F# code, whatever it does, to javascript and lets your code run in any javascript runtime, whether it is the browser, [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [react-native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/), [github electron](https://electronjs.org/) or others.


### Fable uses *bindings* to interact with native javascript APIs

Already introduced in section [Hello World](/chapters/fable/hello-world), a Fable *binding* is a special F# library that contains type definitions and method signatures of native javascript APIs (similar to `.ts.d` files of typescript). In the previous samples, we used `document` from the `Fable.Browser.Dom` binding package which was included in the template, but the library includes a very large and comprehensive bindings for many browser APIs such as [XMLHttpRequest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XMLHttpRequest), [Web Audio](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) and [CanvasRenderingContenxt2D](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CanvasRenderingContext2D) just to name a few. Later on we will explore many other bindings that not only support native APIs like the ones from the browsers but also APIs from third-party libraries that can be seemlessly consumed from within our Fable applications.

### Fable preserves F# semantics
On of the most important aspects of Fable is that it preserves the semantics of F# code and has full support for the F# core library modules such as `List`, `Seq`, `Array`, `Option`, `Map`, `Set`, `Async`, `String` etc. This means that your F# code should run the same way would you expect F# to behave on .NET. The following language consturcts are supported: pattern matching, active patterns, object expressions, structural equality, sequence and list comprehensions, lazy values, anonymous records, classes and computations expressions.

In the previous example, we used two different constructs: mutability and `async` computation expressions. Although mutability is to be avoided in F# applications, sometimes it makes sense to use it for performance gains and Fable supports it.

### F# Async in Javascript

As for `async`, it is natural for Fable to support such construct because javascript runtimes make heavy use of continuations, also known as callbacks. In fact, many if not all native javascript callback-based APIs can be turned into `async` expressions quite easily, for example to convert [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout) in javascript into an async "sleep" function, you can write the following:

```fsharp
open Fable.Core
open Fable.Core.JsInterop

[<Emit("setTimeout($0, $1)")>]
let setTimeout (callback: unit -> unit) (timeout: int) = jsNative

let sleep (n: int) : Async<unit> =
    Async.FromContinuations (fun (resolve, reject, _) ->
        // native javascript function
        // runs callback after n milliseconds
        setTimeout (fun () -> resolve()) n
        |> ignore)

async {
    printfn "Before"
    do! sleep 1000
    printfn "After one second"
}
```

<div style="padding:20px; border: 1px solid lightgrey;border-radius:5px;">
<code>Async.Sleep</code> with Fable is implemented using <code>setTimeout</code> under the hood, however the implementation is more advanced and provides built-in support for cancellation.
</div>

The above snippet uses native javascript and makes use Fable's interop capabilities. Don't worry if you do not understand this right away because of the `Emit` attribute or the `jsNative` value, there will a whole chapter devoted to interoperability from Fable. The take away from this is that it is really simple and easy to use native functionality when needed.


### Unsupported Features

At the time of writing, a couple of F# features are not yet supported, for example F# code quotations and `query` computation expression because it depends on quotations feature.
