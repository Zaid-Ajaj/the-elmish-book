# Audience

Naturally, the book is aimed developers who wish to build front-end web applications using F#, experts and beginners alike. Except for a bit of HTML and CSS knowledge, no prior experience is assumed concerning front-end web development as I will try to explain the concepts needed from the very scratch.

However, the book is *not* an introduction to F# itself. Although proficiency of the language is not required, I will assume you know the basics such as the general syntax, the concept of immutability, pattern matching and a bit of `Async`. I will try to keep it as simple as possible, but this goes to say that I will not spend time explaining F# language constructs from the code snippets unless deemed necessary.

There are great references to help you learn and easily get started with F#:

> I usually hang out on the #web channel in F# slack so I can answer your questions if you get stuck somewhere. Of course, there will many awesome people there as well to help you as well when I happen to be unavailable.
